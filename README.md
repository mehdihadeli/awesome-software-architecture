| [Data Driven Design](docs/data-driven-design.md) | Data-Driven Design is a software development methodology that emphasizes the use of data and analytics to inform design decisions. It involves collecting, analyzing, and using data to create and improve software products, services, and experiences. This approach relies on empirical evidence to guide design choices, and it requires a strong data infrastructure and analytics capabilities. Data-Driven Design can help organizations create more effective, efficient, and user-friendly products and services by making informed decisions based on real-world data. It can also lead to better customer engagement, increased revenue, and improved user satisfaction. |

| [CQRS](docs/cqrs.md) | CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the concerns of command execution and data querying in a system. The basic idea behind CQRS is to split the application model into two separate models: one for reading data and another for writing data. This allows the two models to be optimized for their specific purposes, and provides benefits such as better scalability, performance, and maintainability. The CQRS pattern is often used in conjunction with event sourcing, which is a technique for capturing all changes to an application state as a sequence of events. Together, CQRS and event sourcing can provide a powerful way to build highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems. |

| [Modular Monolith](docs/modular-monolith.md) | Modular Monolith is an architectural approach that combines the advantages of monolithic and microservices architectures. It aims to build a monolithic application with a modular design that allows it to be divided into smaller, more manageable parts, each with its own clear responsibilities and interfaces. This approach allows teams to develop and deploy features independently, while still maintaining a single codebase and database. The modular design also facilitates the testing and maintenance of the application, as well as the scaling of individual modules. |
